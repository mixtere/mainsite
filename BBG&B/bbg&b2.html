Although one meets many people on this path,  being on it is a strenuous solo endeavor. As I move and explore people come and go as I do. The witnesses I have of my experiences are transient.   On this path I have had to learn to embrace and love my own company simply to survive.. And because of the wonders, stress, loneliness and adversity experienced,  a growing sense has developed  that some sort of higher power is along with me for the ride… and will decide when it ends. I have come through too many difficult experiences to come to any other conclusion. Speaking literally as well as metaphorically, this entire endeavor is a search for “home” that I guess that some readers will relate to. Welcome aboard,  Beans’ Bodh Gaya & Beyond.
