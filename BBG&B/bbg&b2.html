  <h2>2- It All Started When… </h2>
<p>As I entered into middle age I found myself running a small home services business in my birthplace of Laguna. It’s main focus was dog services- walking, sitting, grooming and leash-training. Despite the fact that they were really someone else’s property the dogs became great friends. When I wasn’t at the beach or holed up in my shack of an apartment I walked them dodging tourists and blacked-out Range Rovers. Occasionally I housesat and lounged in the beautiful homes of the owners. I  brought in the mail, took out the trash and watered the plants while my clients galavanted around on various trips.	
</p>
<p>Being with the dogs, and a few cats, was what it was all about. They are such wonderful sincere creatures and the best friends I have had to this day. I developed special relationships with them all. We learned to communicate and to trust each other. I was far more in tune with and attentive to them than most of their owners were. We got to go on many adventures, often involving the beach. The dogs and I bonded and learned from each other. When I would take them out, especially my big pack, people were either drawn to or repelled by the sight of us.  The dogs transformed my lone, male self into a trustworthy dog-person. Attractive women approached to visit the dogs and I would pretend that they had stopped to talk with me. Looking around the town I noticed that the percentage of dog owners was increasing. I interpreted this as a sign that people were lonely and needing companionship of the trustworthy variety. The dogs provided this. They brought our often isolated selves into meaningful contact with each other.
</p>
  <p>It was not all great though. With each day Laguna become more wealthy and more overrun with traffic and tourists. I wrestled with a growing pressure from it all but  stayed on,  not knowing what else to do.  I dodged cars and fought with the hordes for space on the sidewalk. There were lots of people on the streets and on the beaches that didn’t know what they were doing with their dogs. There were some fights and a lot of close calls. Considering that my large pack included two mastiffs and a pit bull this was a great stressor. Despite all my efforts I could not guarantee the dogs safety as each day I encountered increasingly erratic behavior from other dogs and their uncaring or clueless owners. Between these people and the traffic were many close calls. I wrestled with the changed around me and the observation that especially in regards to my income, things weren’t working. Laguna is a hard place to leave behind. I eventually concluded that it was a wonderful place at one point and it is a privilege to have known those times. But that Laguna doesn’t exist anymore. The straw that broke the camel’s back was my getting gas/carbon monoxide poisoning from my last hovel of a studio apartment there. After my trip to the hospital I contacted the gas company to inspect the site. After the gas company came and red tagged the oven for carbon monoxide leakage... my landlord took the tag off and told me that it was safe. This was a clear sign to me that I needed to leave. When I looked within all that was there was a resurgent current drawing me  back to Bodh Gaya, Bihar.  There the winds of change and the call of the seeker seemed to promise freedom to me.  
</p>
<p>I had to dig really deep to find the courage to leave Laguna and make the move. It was impossible to ignore that I needed a new place to live. I resolved to take the chance. Immediately after doing that it dawned on me that I was not prepared for the journey. Twenty three years had passed since I had participated in Antioch College’s Buddhist Studies program in Bodh Gaya. In that time I had returned to India only once- in 2000, to visit an ashram in the south that my mother was familiar with. There was much work to do. I reached out to the old director of the program, Robert Pryor, and he responded supportively.  I contacted the program’s student alumni group to ask for help. Two former participants wrote back. With their and Robert’s direction I began the process of preparation. I used the old program primer as a guide to apply for a “ten-year visa,” arrange for medication and inoculations and other preparations. Pathetically, next to deciding to go the most difficult thing was dealing with my stuff. This drew a powerful blow to my ego, which identified itself as a minimalist. But it was clear that I was owned by my stuff.  First went the easy things; big stuff, heavy stuff, then tools, then clothes then old audio and computer stuff. As the pile dwindled the process got gradually harder. I had to reorient myself to the traveler mindset of carrying the essentials my back and leaving all else behind. This was a process more difficult and less romantic that people give it credit for.
</p>
  <p>The last thing to go was the car.  It’s hard to operate in America without one.  Aside from that there are attachments of convenience and one’s identity bound up with the personal automobile.  Miraculously, about three days before my plane was scheduled to take off I was able to sell the car for the full asking price. With this done, for the last three days I continued to struggle with the “stuff” issue. I would pack my luggage, find the capacity insufficient, eliminate things, repack,  repeat and repeat again. When I was done I had what I thought was one modest backpacking pack and a large standard backpack- bursting at the seams but ready to travel. I felt vulnerable and naked without my beloved stuff yet also free.
</p>
  <p>On the morning of my departure my airport transport pulled up, I hopped in the front seat and the driver commenced to talking my ear off for the entire trip to LAX. The poor driver was obviously in need of some company. It turned out this man and his wife were living hand to mouth as I had been. They were working as  subcontractors for a large transportation company that I shall refrain from naming.  As the lonely driver talked at me I learned how paltry his earnings were. Just like me he and his wife, despite graduate degrees, were having great difficulty in getting by in the high rent reality of California. In addition to feeling compassion for them I felt that I had made the right decision in heading out on the journey. The driver dropped me off at the Cathay Pacific terminal and we said our goodbyes.  Then I entered the airport and things got very real. I had entered into that surreal moment;  the last vestiges of my previous reality framed in the humdrum, practical steps of check-in, baggage check, airport stroll and a bunch of waiting. I was about to board what was essentially a time machine that would whisk me to another world. When I was aboard the plane the enormity of what I had done hit me. Anxiety and excitement pulsed through me in waves. The plane taxied and waited and taxied some more, as if to build tension. Then the engines roared to life. We began picking up speed. Out the window I could see the land that I knew moving faster and faster. Then my heart surged and freefell within my chest as the nose of the plane rose and we lifted off.
