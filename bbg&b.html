<p>What led to my launch was being dissatisfied with living very close to the bone trying to rent an apartment and run a dog services business in my birthplace of Laguna Beach, California. Although very beautiful and still very special to me, this town has gone through a gradual process of losing its character and the values that founded it through a mercurial rise in population, popularity, cost, ostentatiousness and one-percenter republicanism. I found myself feeling more and more pinched and thinking of the time I spent in India as a young buck. I figured I would start there and decide where else to go as things developed. Beans Bodh Gaya and Beyond is a series of true stories told in sequence that tell the tale of my adventures leading up to the pandemic. It reflects a human experience, not that of a company or organization. My hope is that some readers will appreciate and be able to relate to this perspective. </p>
    <p>India in particular has always paired well with the unrelenting drive to explore and discover the world and one’s self.  It has always seemed that the richness and diversity of the land offered fertile ground for such endeavors. For me and so many other Westerners India is a mystifying, intriguing place. It overwhelms, it calms, it delights, it horrifies- all simultaneously. And always there is more to know about it, hidden things and things forgotten or not spoken of to the foreigner. It seems to me that upon alighting there travelers immediately either love or hate India. I loved it upon arrival.  I am not a grizzled travel veteran but I have seen some of the world. Among this experience India ranks as the most difficult and rewarding place that I have traveled to. My take is that it is a land of great contrasts and anomalies- a place full of both rigid systematic order and wild chaos, of asphyxiating control and liberating freedom, of modern innovation and primitive technology, of high learning and appalling ignorance, of great wealth and unimaginable poverty.  All cultures have their contradictions. My experience of India is that these contradictions are more extreme, hence the forthcoming shock and or awe. Perhaps like other Westerners that are drawn to India, my own [American] culture feels alienating and small-minded. I have not fit well into my own capitalist society. My asking “why” and looking at things deeply or literally has frustrated many a friend, professor and boss. But these activities have fit well with many of the Eastern meditative traditions that originate from India, especially my study and practice of Buddhism.  What is present here is the pursuit of experiencing insight into the deeper questions in life. I think many people oriented like this find themselves in India.

    <p>Although one meets many people on this path,  being on it is a strenuous solo endeavor. As I move and explore people come and go as I do. The witnesses I have of my experiences are transient.   On this path I have had to learn to embrace and love my own company simply to survive.. And because of the wonders, stress, loneliness and adversity experienced,  a growing sense has developed  that some sort of higher power is along with me for the ride… and will decide when it ends. I have come through too many difficult experiences to come to any other conclusion. Speaking literally as well as metaphorically, this entire endeavor is a search for “home” that I guess that some readers will relate to. Welcome aboard,  Beans’ Bodh Gaya & Beyond.
