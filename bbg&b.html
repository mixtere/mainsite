    <h2>Beans Body Gaya & Beyond</h2>
<p>Many years ago I lived and studied in Bodh Gaya, Bihar as part of Antioch College’s Antioch Education Abroad Buddhist Studies abroad program. The experience was the highlight of my life. I could not get over the experience of living in India at that time. It was a simpler, purer existence that I took to very well. There were no cell phones and little internet. Electricity was sporadic. Bihar was very poor and very beautiful too. I got up early to meditate, got food poisoning, adventured on the trains, dodged dogs, rode rusty Indian bicycles, learned to navigate beggars and and haggle, got giardiah, sweltered in the steamy monsoon and shivered in the Himalayan heights. I was not ready for it to end when January came around but it did anyway. The suddenness with which it all came to an end was difficult to handle.  I tried my best to hold onto the memories as uneventful and dreary years followed each other into my middle age. The memories would not leave me alone though. I had long since stopped talking about it as people didn’t really want ot hear about it. </p>
<p>Then, twenty-three years later I decided to follow my heart, quit my job, sell or gave away my things and return to the place I had longed to for over two decades. This is the story of how that panned out…Beans’ Body Gaya and Beyond!</p>
